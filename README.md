# 2048 Game in Python

This project is a Python implementation of the classic 2048 game. The game board is a 4x4 grid where tiles slide smoothly when the player moves them using the arrow keys. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Installation
Clone the repository:

https://github.com/MedhajSarang/2048-Game-.git

### Running the Game
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

python 2048.py

### Gameplay
Use the w, a, s, d to move the tiles.

Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.

The game ends when you reach the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves.
